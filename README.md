This software is being created to allow for more generalized music production than a conventional music software might provide.

Its main appeal comes from 2 things:
  1. its time signatures. The program allows for each track, or 'thread' to have its own divisions of the measure.
This allows for interesting time signatures and polyrhythms.
  2. Its scale builder. This allows for the use of any scale one can dream of by putting it into the builder.
This lets people go much more experimental, as they can play notes outside even of the traditional western scale.

Good luck figuring it out!
